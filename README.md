# Project Description
waterme is a quirky mobile app designed to help you keep your virtual plants happy and alive by watering them and tracking their health through fun animations and sounds.

# The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wished your phone could nag you about watering your plants? Or wanted to see how a cactus feels when it’s thirsty? We fixed that — for absolutely no real reason!

# The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an app that shows your plants in three states — happy, weak, or dead — based on how much water you give them. Plus, each state plays a unique background sound because why not?

This is a light-hearted virtual plant watering app made purely for fun.
You can increase the water level using the Water button, but over time, the water level decreases on its own. As it drops, the plant goes through three transitions:

🌱 Happy (well-watered)

🥀 Weak (needs water)

💀 Dead (too late!)

Each transition is paired with matching background audio for extra fun. Think of it as a silly mini-game for bored moments!
