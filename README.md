# Project Description
waterme is a quirky mobile app designed to help you keep your virtual plants happy and alive by watering them and tracking their health through fun animations and sounds.

# The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever wished your phone could nag you about watering your plants? Or wanted to see how a cactus feels when it’s thirsty? We fixed that — for absolutely no real reason!

# The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created an app that shows your plants in three states — happy, weak, or dead — based on how much water you give them. Plus, each state plays a unique background sound because why not?
